# Introduction to R

## 1 What is R?

R stands as a formidable and highly adaptable programming language specifically
designed for statistical computing, data analysis, and data science. 

Developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland,
New Zealand, in the early 1990s, R has evolved into an open-source programming
language, boasting an extensive suite of statistical and graphical features.


### 1.1 R as a Statistical Computing Environment

R serves as a comprehensive statistical computing environment, providing an
expansive repertoire of tools and libraries tailored for data manipulation, 
statistical modeling, and visualization. Its strength lies in its ability to
handle and analyze large datasets efficiently, making it a preferred choice for
statisticians, data scientists, and researchers across various domains.


## Historical Background and Development of R

### Origins of R

The roots of R can be traced back to the S language, developed at Bell Laboratories
in the 1970s by John Chambers and his colleagues. R emerged as an open-source
implementation of the S language, offering a free alternative to proprietary
statistical software.


### Evolution and Community Involvement

Over the years, R has undergone continuous development and improvement, driven 
by a very vibrant and active community of developers and statisticians. The
Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) serves as a central repository for R
packages, fostering collaboration and sharing of statistical methodologies and
tools.


## R's Significance in Statistical Computing

### Statistical Analysis

R is renowned for its extensive statistical functions and packages, 
making it an ideal tool for data analysis and hypothesis testing. From basic 
descriptive statistics to advanced modeling techniques, R provides a wide 
array of tools to analyze and interpret data.

### Data Visualization

One of R's standout features is its robust data visualization capabilities. 
The ggplot2 package, for example, allows users to create a wide range of 
high-quality graphs and charts, enabling effective communication of data
insights.

### Machine Learning

In machine learning, R has gained popularity with packages like
caret, randomForest, and xgboost. These packages facilitate the implementation
of various machine learning algorithms, empowering users to build predictive
models and conduct advanced analytics.

## Why Should I Learn R?
As a specialized language meticulously designed for statistical computing and
data analysis, R stands out as a powerful ally for professionals and enthusiasts
alike. By mastering R, you gain access to a versatile toolset that empowers you
to efficiently handle and analyze vast and diverse datasets, conduct robust
statistical analyses, and create captivating visualizations. The open-source
nature of R, coupled with its extensive community support and continuous
evolution, ensures that you stay at the forefront of advancements in statistical
methodologies and cutting-edge tools. 

Whether you are a statistician, data scientist, researcher,
or professional from any domain, learning R opens doors to a realm of
possibilities, enabling you to elevate your skills and make meaningful
contributions in your chosen field.


In this course, you will learn about R's immense potential in terms of
statistical computing and you will be equipped with the skills to know how to 
harness this potential and apply it in any field you might need to use R in.

## Setting Up R and RStudio

RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that gives us a
single place to code and manage a project in R.

To use RStudio, you need to install R first.

You can install the appropriate version of R for your system here:

-   [Download R for
    Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
-   [Download R for MAC](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)

After downloading, follow the instructions to install R on your
computer.

After R is successfully installed, you can install RStudio. - [Download
RStudio for Windows](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) -
[Download RStudio for MAC](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

## Using RStudio

After successfully downloading R and RStudio, you are finally ready to
start coding in R! Wait... or are you?

It is often best practice to learn how to create a project in R.

What is a project? A project is like a central where all your R code
files can be stored and also any data you might work with. It is
important as it makes your program much more organized and will save you
a lot of headache when you code.

### RStudio Interface

To create a new project, navigate to top-left of your window to 1. File
-\> New Project 2. Select New Directory 3. Select New Project 4. Enter a
name for your project 5. Click on Create Project

And voila! You have created your first project in R

### R Console

The R Console is where all the R code you type will be executed. It
serves as a command line interpreter which allows you to execute R code
one line by a time.

### R Script

In the context of coding, typing R code one at a time is not effective.
Enter R scripts! An R Script is basically a plain text file containing
multiple lines or sequences of R code. Scripts are better as they make
our code organized, readable and reproducible.

QUICK TIP: To create a new R Script, you can use Ctrl + Shift + N

### Other Interfaces
-   There is a pane for Environment where all objects created by your
    code are stored.
-   History where all the previous code you run are kept. There is a
    pane where you can see your project files, plots created by your
    code, as well as packages on your system.

RStudio provides a user-friendly environment for coding debugging and
data visualization. It features a script editor, a console, a workspace
viewer, enhanced functionality for package management and even version
control!
